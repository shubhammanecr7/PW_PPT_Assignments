ðŸ’¡ **Question 8**
Given two strings s and goal, return true *if you can swap two letters in* s *so the result is equal
 to* goal*, otherwise, return* false*.*
Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping
 the characters at s[i] and s[j].
- For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".
**Example 1:**
**Input:** s = "ab", goal = "ba"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
