	 * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
	 * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its
	 * index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the
	 * peaks. You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an
	 * element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is
	 * outside the array. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
	 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1] Output: 2 Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your
	 * function should return the index number 2.
